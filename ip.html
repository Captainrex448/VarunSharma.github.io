                                    <h3>"CyberPunk Keychain"</h3>Not too long ago a show call "Cyberpunk Edgerunners" came out. It quickly became one of my favorite shows and I fell in love
                                    with the artistic designs of the show. The main character has a symbol that he wears on his back, and i decided to make a keychain of the logo because I loved
                                    the logo. </p></span>

                                    <h3>Phone Case 2.0 (WIP)</h3><p>I made my original phone case back in my sopohmore year, but I now feel that with the skills that I have learned now I can do a much better job
                                        than what I had done in my sopohmore year. This time I plan on creating a design that focuses mainly on negative and positive space.

                                    <h3>Darth Vader Lightsaber replica </h3>In my junior year I decided to try out the 3D modeling software, Blender. So I decided to make something simple and not too hard, I chose to model Darth Vader's lightsaber. I chose his lightsaber
                                        because I am a hugeeeee fan of Star Wars.  I made the base model for the hilt but did not add materials to it yet. Hopefuly in the future i can come back to this project and maybe expand upon it more.

                                    <h3>Wood Portfolio Book</h3>In my Junior year I joined an after school course called MakerLab. In this class we worked on creating portfolio books from wood for ourselves.
                                    We first started with coming up with our design for the front cover. We each had to take inspiration from nature and I chose a close up image of a leaf. After 
                                    we traced over our sketches with micron markers, we imported a picture onto Illustrator to fix any line issues. After fixing the sketches in Illustrator 
                                    we got to laser cutting. Below is the nature pattern I chose and my sketch.
                                    I chose to actually etch my design onto the wood instead of cutting it because I felt that would be better for my design.</span></p>

                                    <h3>Star Wars Cantina Bar (WIP)</h3> Another project of mine, a star wars cantina bar. There is still some more to it that I have to complete before I can say
                                    its finished. But I plan on finishing this along with Phone Case 2.0 soon. Below is a screenshot of the 3D model itself and the reference image I used.</span></p>

                                    <h3>Wood Portfolio Book V2</h3>This was my most recent project for my IDA class. The project required us to either create a portfolio book or a box with our designs cut from wood.
                                    I chose to make another portfolio book as i felt that i could come up with a unique design for it. My design took inspiration from a city grid system with each square  
                                    representing a building or other structure. I had printed two layers of my design the first layer was the initial design and the second layer was an offset of the first layer
                                    .I then glued the two layers together and ended up with my final product.</span></p>
